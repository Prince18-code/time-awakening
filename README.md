# ⏳ Time Awakening

**Time Awakening** is a dark, minimal, and thought-provoking web experience built with pure JavaScript.  
It is not just a clock — it is a reminder that **time never waits**.

> *“Time is like a river — you can’t touch the same water twice,  
because the flow that has passed will never pass again.”*

## 🧠 Concept

This project represents time as something **cold, continuous, and unforgiving**.

While the clock runs silently, powerful messages appear beside it —  
forcing the user to confront a simple truth:

**Every second you waste is gone forever.**
